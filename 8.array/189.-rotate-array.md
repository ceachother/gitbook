> To avoid this problem, we could buffer `nums[i + k]` before we shift `nums[i]`, but such a modification, albeit feasible for the problem, would fail the O\(1\) space requirement: you need O\(n - k\) space to buffer the entries.

> This **Cyclic Replacements** solution, on the other hand, overcomes this problem: only one buffer variable `prev` is shared for all shifts of all `n` elements\(although the code declares new `current, prev, etc.` in each iteration, JVM optimization can handle that, or you can always just make these variables global to the loop block anyway\).

> **Caveat**: the proof for this case is incorrect, or at least incomplete. If you are not curious how it is incorrect, you can skip this part. The key error I made is I only proved that **no duplicate index is visited during one inner-loop**, but I did not prove **only one inner-loop will be executed**.

> if `n % k != 0`, the outer loop will only execute one iteration\(`start == 0`\) before the algorithm finisheds.  
> If `n % k != 0`, the inner do-while loop will only terminate when `count == n`. Consider what this inner loop does: for example, in the case of `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`and `k = 2`, it essentially does something like moving values \(not indexes\) in this way: `1 -> 3, 3 -> 5, 5 -> 7, 7 -> 2, 2 -> 4, 4 -> 6, 6 -> 1`, and then`start == current` and `count == n == 7`. We will then have to try to get to the second iteration of the outer loop, which fails due to `count == n`. Thus the outer loop only executes one iteration.  
> Now let's abstract: when `n % k != 0`, we start from `[0]` and in this one iteration, we can shift all `n` elements \(to its perspectively correct position\). This is because each `current` in the do-while loop will all be distinct indices \(other than the last one that reaches `start` and ends the loop\).
>
> **Lemma2**: No duplicate indexes will be visited \(other than `start`\) in each inner-loop.  
> **Proof**: This is proven by contradiction. Now, for convenience, let's consider the chain of _index_ movements rather than the chain of _value_ movements. For the instance of `n=7, k=3`, we have:
>
> ```text
> 0 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 0
> ```
>
> This is a chain of length 7 \(in terms of number of distinct indexes in the chain\).  
> We start from `start`, then move `current` from there, till `current` reaches `start` again. What we want to prove is, during this process, `current` never duplicates itself before it reach the final `start`. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that it did, then we have a chain like:
>
> ```text
> start -> ... -> a -> ... -> a -> ... -> start
> A               B           C           D
> ```
>
> Where the index `a` is picked twice by the pointer `current`, also `a ≠ start` \(otherwise the inner-loop would have terminated at the first `a`\). No `a` or `start` is included in any of the three `...` segment WLOG.  
> A trivial way to prove this is that, by the above assumptions, the BC segment has no `start`, which means, you start from `a`, you will reach `a` before reaching a `start`. But looking at the CD segment, you will have another conclusion: starting from `a`, you will reach `start` before reaching `a`, where `a ≠ start`. This is a contradiction.  
> **End of proof for Lemma2**  
> Thus concludes my attempt for this case. Note that this case's proof is incomplete in that I proved that no duplicate indexes shall be reached in one inner-loop. But I did not prove that _only_ one inner-loop will execute in this case: in fact, that is a false claim. As pointed out by @ibici.  
> I could add on more augments to this proof but @ibici 's advice made me rethink about my classification of the two cases here and I eventually see how it is not a good choice. In **attempt 2**, I will try to provide the proof in a better way.

> For each `start` value of the outer loop, it is obvious to see that the inner loop does `n / k` iterations, visiting one distinct indice in each iteration.

It has to be `k`, because in each outer loop, `count` get incremented `n / k` no matter what \(even if there are duplicates across different outer loop iterations/`start` values, which we shall debunk later\). So the domain of `start` is `0..k-1`. **marker here**

There is also a [nice solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/11349/my-three-way-to-solve-this-problem-the-first-way-is-interesting-java) here using a similar idea. I would learn that one as well if I were you.

> As the length of the chain grows, think carefully when would we actually stop? Yes, we would stop when we reached a length `L` such that `L` is a multiple of both `n`and `k`. To be more accurate, we stop when `L` is the LCM of `n` and `k`.  
> If the chain started from somewhere like `1` rather than `0`, the end result is actually similar, `L` will always be an LCM and thus a multiple of `n`.

> From the **lemma2** proved in **attempt 1**, we already know that within one chain, which corresponds to one inner-loop \(in that the chain terminates when the first duplciate is reached, which is `start`\), there is no other duplicate index than `start`. But how long can this chain be? Of course, it can't exceed `n`: you only have `n`distinct indexes. In the example above, the first chain \(corresponds to `start=0`\) has length `chain_len=n=7`, which triggers `count=n` to terminate the outer-loop immediately.

>
> This chain is only of length 5, and we have `n=10`, so in the end we need two separate chains, corresponding to two inner-loop executions, to traverse all `n` indexes. We have:

> L   = (10) * 2 = ((2) * 5) * 2

> Now, compare the two cases, you should see how LCM and GCD plays a part in this algorithm. We first find the GCD of `n` and `k`. Then we can calculate `L`, which is the LCM, then we can divide it by `k`, then we have the length of this chain.

> These information are not explicitly utilied in the code, but is helpful for understanding the correctness of the algorithm overall. The beauty of this cyclic replacement code as compared to [this solution](https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/11349/my-three-way-to-solve-this-problem-the-first-way-is-interesting-java) where GCD calculations are done explicitly is that everything just, happens, and it's correct.

> **Lemma 3**: each index will be traversed exactly once during the entire outer-loop.  
> **Proof**:  
> First, each index will belong to exactly one of the disjoint chains. This derives naturally from how we proved the chains to be disjoint in the first place.  
> Secondly, from **lemma 1**, we know that each index will be touched no more than once within each inner-loop \(chain\).
>
> Now, what conclusion do we have by now: each index will be touched _no more than once_ in the entire outer-loop.  
> This is not enough, we want _exactly_ touched once.
>
> The outer loop will only terminate when `count=n` which means we visited all `n` indexes, which are guaranteed to be distinct from above discussion. Does this statement suffice?  
> Well, in the case of `n ≥ 10`, what if we had three inner-loops each contributing 4, 4, 4 to `count`? In this case, `chain_len=4` and in the end we will have `count=12>n` to terminate the outer-loop.  
> This case is not possible because the length of each chain is deterministically calculated as shown above: `chain_len = L / k`:

> The `chain_len` is actually `n / GCD`, somebody else help me prove this please.  
> Assume this is right, then it is clear that `chain_len` can divide into `n`, and the case of `n,chain_len=10,4` is impossible. Ruling out that possibility, the outer-loop's termination iff _exactly `n` distinct indexes visited_ is enough to justify the lemma and the algorithm: `n` is a multiple of `chain_len`, we will have exactly `n=count` in the end. All distinct, so each index touched exactly once.  
> **End of proof for lemma3**.  
> The termination of the algorithm also trivially follows from **lemma 3**.
