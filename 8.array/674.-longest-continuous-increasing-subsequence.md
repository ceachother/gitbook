# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest `continuous` increasing subsequence \(subarray\).
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
> Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
> ```
>
> **Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

## Solution: Sliding window

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findLengthOfLCIS(self, nums):
        ans = anchor = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i and nums[i-1] >= nums[i]: anchor = i
            ans = max(ans, i - anchor + 1)
        return ans
```
