# 740. Delete And Earn

> Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.
>
> In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.
>
> You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [3, 4, 2]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: 
> Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
> Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
> Output: 9
> Explanation: 
> Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.
> Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
> 9 total points are earned.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.
>
> Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

## Solution: DP

```java
class Solution {
    public int deleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int[] counts = new int[10001];
        for(int n : nums) counts[n]++;
        
        int includePrev = 0;
        int excludePrev = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i<=10000; i++) {
            int temp = excludePrev;
            excludePrev = Math.max(includePrev, excludePrev);
            includePrev = i*counts[i] + temp;
        }
        return Math.max(excludePrev, includePrev);
    }
}
```

> 1. If we sort all the numbers into `buckets` indexed by these numbers, this is essentially asking you to repetitively take an bucket while giving up the 2 buckets next to it. \(the range of these numbers is \[1, 10000\]\)
> 2. The optimal final result can be derived by keep updating 2 variables `skip_i`, `take_i`, which stands for: `skip_i` : the best result for sub-problem of first `(i+1)` buckets from `0` to `i`, while you **skip** the `i`th bucket. `take_i` : the best result for sub-problem of first `(i+1)` buckets from `0` to `i`, while you **take** the `i`th bucket.
> 3. DP formula: `take[i] = skip[i-1] + values[i];` `skip[i] = Math.max(skip[i-1], take[i-1]);` `take[i]` can only be derived from: if you skipped the `[i-1]`th bucket, and you take bucket\[i\]. `skip[i]` through, can be derived from either `take[i-1]` or `skip[i-1]`, whatever the bigger;
