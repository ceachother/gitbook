# 552. Student Attendance Record II

> Given a positive integer **n**, return the number of all possible attendance records with length n, which will be regarded as rewardable. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.
>
> A student attendance record is a string that only contains the following three characters:
>
> 1. **'A'** : Absent.
> 2. **'L'** : Late.
> 3. **'P'** : Present.
>
> A record is regarded as rewardable if it doesn't contain **more than one 'A' \(absent\)** or **more than two continuous 'L' \(late\)**.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: n = 2
> Output: 8 
> Explanation:
> There are 8 records with length 2 will be regarded as rewardable:
> "PP" , "AP", "PA", "LP", "PL", "AL", "LA", "LL"
> Only "AA" won't be regarded as rewardable owing to more than one absent times. 
> ```
>
> **Note:** The value of **n** won't exceed 100,000.

        result = (nums[n] + nums[n-1] + nums[n-2]) % M
        # for rewardable record with A, everytime replace on element in the record.
        # After inserting "A", the record is broken into two parts: 
        # left part contains i-1 numbers, right part contains n-1-i numbers
        for i in range(n):
            result += nums[i+1] * nums[n-i] % M
            result %= M
