# 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

> Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
> ```
>
> **Note:** Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.

## Solution: DP

```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = len(nums)
        if l<=1: return l
        dp = [0]*l
        count = [1]*l
        max_count = 0
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, l):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    if dp[j] >= dp[i]:
                        dp[i] = dp[j]+1
                        count[i] = count[j]
                    elif dp[j]+1 == dp[i]:
                        count[i] += count[j]
            
            if dp[i] > max_count:
                max_count = dp[i]
                ans = count[i]
            elif dp[i] == max_count:
                ans += count[i]
        return ans
