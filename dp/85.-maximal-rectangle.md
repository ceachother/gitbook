# 85. Maximal Rectangle

> Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   ["1","0","1","0","0"],
>   ["1","0","1","1","1"],
>   ["1","1","1","1","1"],
>   ["1","0","0","1","0"]
> ]
> Output: 6

## Solution: DP + Stack

For each row, treat it as [84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](../3.stack/largest-rectangle-in-histogram.md)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximalRectangle(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[str]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if len(matrix)==0 or len(matrix[0])==0: return 0
        
        h, w = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        height = [0]*(w+1)
        area = 0
        for row in matrix:
            for i in range(w):
                height[i]=height[i]+1 if row[i]=='1' else 0
            stack = [-1]
            for i in range(w+1):
                while height[i]<height[stack[-1]]:
                    area_h = height[stack.pop()]
                    area_w = i-1 - stack[-1]
                    area = max(area_h*area_w, area)
                stack.append(i)
        return area
            
```
