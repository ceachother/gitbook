# 472. Concatenated Words

> Given a list of words \(**without duplicates**\), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
>
> A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.
>
> **Example:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
>
> Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
>
> Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
>  "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
> "ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. The number of elements of the given array will not exceed `10,000`
> 2. The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed `600,000`.
> 3. All the input string will only include lower case letters.
> 4. The returned elements order does not matter.

```python

        s = set()
        
        def contains(word):
            if not s: return False
            w_len = len(word)
            dp = [False]*(w_len+1)
            dp[0] = True
            for j in range(1, w_len+1):
                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):
                    if dp[k] and word[k:j] in s:
                        dp[j] = True
                        break
            return dp[w_len]       
                
        words.sort(key = lambda w: (len(w)))
        l = len(words)
        s = set()
        ans = []
