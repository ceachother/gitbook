# 322. Coin Change

> You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money amount. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
> Output: -1
> ```

## Solution 1: DFS\(TLE\)

## Solution 2: DFS with DP

```text
int count = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount];
        return dfs(coins, amount, dp);
    }
    
    public int dfs(int[] coins, int amount, int[] dp) {
        if(amount < 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        if(amount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if(dp[amount-1] != 0) {
            return dp[amount-1];
        }
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0; i<coins.length; i++) {
            int count = dfs(coins, amount-coins[i], dp);
            if(count >=0 && count < min) {
                min = count+1;
            }
        }
        dp[amount-1] = min == Integer.MAX_VALUE? -1: min;
        return dp[amount-1];
    }
```

Note that when assign value to dp\[amount\], it's better to assign the value at the bottom of the function, multiple assignment may cause troubles and it's hard to find.

instead of calculating from 0 to the amount, it deduct from the amount to 0 and return the calculation times.

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : O\(S∗n\). where S is the amount, n is denomination count. In the worst case the recursive tree of the algorithm has height of SS and the algorithm solves only SS subproblems because it caches precalculated solutions in a table. Each subproblem is computed with nn iterations, one by coin denomination. Therefore there is O\(S\*n\)O\(S∗n\) time complexity.
* Space complexity : O\(S\)O\(S\), where SS is the amount to change We use extra space for the memoization table.
