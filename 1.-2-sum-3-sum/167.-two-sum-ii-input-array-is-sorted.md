# 167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

> Given an array of integers that is already _**sorted in ascending order**_, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
>
> The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Your returned answers \(both index1 and index2\) are not zero-based.
> * You may assume that each input would have _exactly_ one solution and you may not use the _same_ element twice.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
> ```

## Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers, target):
        """
        :type numbers: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        res = dict()
        for i in range(len(numbers)):
            if target - numbers[i] in res.keys():
                return [res[target-numbers[i]], i + 1]
            else:
                res[numbers[i]] = i + 1
```
