# 22. Generate Parentheses

> Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.

> For example, given n = 3, a solution set is:
>
> ```text
> [
>   "((()))",
>   "(()())",
>   "(())()",
>   "()(())",
>   "()()()"
> ]
> ```

## Solution: DFS and backtracking

```java
public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
    List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
    dfs(n, n, "", list);
    return list;
}

public void dfs(int openLeft, int closeLeft, String str, List<String> list) {
    if(openLeft < 0 || closeLeft < 0) {
        return;
    }
    if(openLeft+closeLeft == 0) {
        list.add(str);
        return;
    }
    if(openLeft != 0) {
        dfs(openLeft-1, closeLeft, str+"(", list);
    }
    if(openLeft == closeLeft) {
        return;
    }
    dfs(openLeft, closeLeft-1, str+")", list);
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

Our complexity analysis rests on understanding how many elements there are in `generateParenthesis(n)`. This analysis is outside the scope of this article, but it turns out this is the `n`-th Catalan number $$\dfrac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}â€‹$$ , which is bounded asymptotically by $$\dfrac{4^n}{n\sqrt{n}}$$ .

* Time Complexity : $$O(\dfrac{4^n}{\sqrt{n}})$$. Each valid sequence has at most `n` steps during the backtracking procedure.
* Space Complexity : $$O(\dfrac{4^n}{\sqrt{n}})$$, as described above, and using $$O(n)$$ space to store the sequence.
