# 465. Optimal Account Balancing

> A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money. For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10. Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride. We can model each transaction as a tuple \(x, y, z\) which means person x gave person y $z. Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively \(0, 1, 2 are the person's ID\), the transactions can be represented as `[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]]`.
>
> Given a list of transactions between a group of people, return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. A transaction will be given as a tuple \(x, y, z\). Note that `x â‰  y` and `z > 0`.
> 2. Person's IDs may not be linear, e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons 0, 2, 6.

> ```text

>
> Output:
> 2
>
> Explanation:
> Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
> Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
>
> Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.

> ```text
> Input:
> [[0,1,10], [1,0,1], [1,2,5], [2,0,5]]
>
> Output:
> 1
>
> Explanation:
> Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
> Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
> Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
> Person #2 gave person #0 $5.

> Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.

## Solution: DFS and Backtracking

After putting the debts in the hashmap, this question becomes looking for pairs or numbers that can make summation equals to 0.

```java
class Solution {
    int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    public int minTransfers(int[][] transactions) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> degree = new HashMap<>();
        for(int[] tran : transactions) {
            degree.put(tran[0], degree.getOrDefault(tran[0], 0)-tran[2]);
            degree.put(tran[1], degree.getOrDefault(tran[1], 0)+tran[2]);
        }
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int debt : degree.values()) {
            if(debt != 0) list.add(debt);
        }
        dfs(0,0,list);
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : result;
    }
    
    //Calculate all combination of the sumation of numbers with opposite sign
    public void dfs(int index, int count, List<Integer> debts) {
        while(index<debts.size() && debts.get(index) == 0) index++;
        if(index == debts.size()) {
            result = Math.min(count, result);
            return;
        }
        for(int i = index+1; i<debts.size(); i++) {
            if((debts.get(index)<0 && debts.get(i)>0) || 
               (debts.get(index)>0 && debts.get(i)<0)) {
                debts.set(i, debts.get(i)+debts.get(index));
                //start from index+1 in next recursion
                dfs(index+1, count+1, debts);
                debts.set(i, debts.get(i)-debts.get(index));
            }
        }
    }
}
```
