# 683. K Empty Slots

> There is a garden with `N` slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The `N` flowers will bloom one by one in `N` days. In each day, there will be `exactly` one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.
>
> Given an array `flowers` consists of number from `1` to `N`. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.
>
> For example, `flowers[i] = x` means that the unique flower that blooms at day `i` will be at position `x`, where `i` and `x` will be in the range from `1` to `N`.
>
> Also given an integer `k`, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is `k` and these flowers are not blooming.
>
> If there isn't such day, output -1.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> flowers: [1,3,2]
> k: 1
> Output: 2
> Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> flowers: [1,2,3]
> k: 1
> Output: -1
> ```

> 1. The given array will be in the range \[1, 20000\].

## Solution 1: Sliding window

```java
public int kEmptySlots(int[] flowers, int k) {
        int[] days = new int[flowers.length+1];
        for(int i = 0; i<flowers.length; i++) {
            days[flowers[i]]=i+1;
        }
        int start = 1;
        int end = k+2;
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 2; end<days.length; i++) {
            if(days[i] > days[start] && days[i] > days[end]) {
                continue;
            }
            if(i == end) {
                result = Math.min(result, Math.max(days[start], days[end]));
            }
            //move the sliding window
            start = i;
            end = start + k + 1;
        }
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }
```

## Solution 2: Binary Search Tree\(TreeSet\)

利用Binary Search Tree的性质，可以找出一个flowers\[i\]前一个的key和后一个key，如果刚好之间间隔k，则返回天数。这里我们用treeSet来实现binary search tree.

```java
class Solution {
    public int kEmptySlots(int[] flowers, int k) {
        if (flowers == null || k >= flowers.length) {
            return -1;
        }

        TreeSet<Integer> tree = new TreeSet();
        int day = 0;

        for (int flower : flowers) {
            ++day;
            tree.add(flower);

            Integer low = tree.lower(flower);
            Integer high = tree.higher(flower);

            if ((low != null && low == flower - k - 1) 
                || (high != null && high == flower + k + 1)) {
                return day;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
