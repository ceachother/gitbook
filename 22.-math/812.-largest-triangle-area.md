# 812. Largest Triangle Area

> You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.

> ```text
> Example:
> Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: 
> The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the largest.

> **Notes:**
>
> * `3 <= points.length <= 50`.
> * No points will be duplicated.
> *  `-50 <= points[i][j] <= 50`.
> * Answers within `10^-6` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution: Math

> We will have 3 for loops to cycle through each choice of 3 points in the array.
>
> After, we'll need a function to calculate the area given 3 points. Here we have some options:
>
> * We can use the Shoelace formula directly, which tells us the area given the 3 points;
> * We can use Heron's formula, which requires the 3 side lengths which we can get by taking the distance of two points;
> * We can use the formula `area = 0.5 * a * b * sin(C)` and calculate the angle `C` with trigonometry.
>
> Our implementation illustrates the use of the shoelace formula.
>
> If we did not know the shoelace formula, we could derive it for triangles with the following approach: starting with points `(px, py), (qx, qy), (rx, ry)`, the area of this triangle is the same under a translation by `(-rx, -ry)`, so that the points become `(px-rx, py-ry), (qx-rx, qy-ry), (0, 0)`.
>
> From there, we could draw a square around the triangle with sides touching the coordinate axes, and calculate the area of the square minus the area of the right triangles surrounding the inner triangle.
>
> For more on this approach, see the [Wikipedia entry for the Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula).
