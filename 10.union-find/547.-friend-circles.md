# 547. Friend Circles

> There are **N** students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. For example, if A is a **direct** friend of B, and B is a **direct** friend of C, then A is an **indirect** friend of C. And we defined a friend circle is a group of students who are direct or indirect friends.
>
> Given a **N\*N** matrix **M** representing the friend relationship between students in the class. If M\[i\]\[j\] = 1, then the ith and jth students are **direct** friends with each other, otherwise not. And you have to output the total number of friend circles among all the students.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,0],
>  [0,0,1]]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, so they are in a friend circle. 
> The 2nd student himself is in a friend circle. So return 2.
> ```

> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> [[1,1,0],
>  [1,1,1],
>  [0,1,1]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation:The 0th and 1st students are direct friends, the 1st and 2nd students are direct friends, 
> so the 0th and 2nd students are indirect friends. All of them are in the same friend circle, so return 1.

> 1. N is in range \[1,200\].
> 2. M\[i\]\[i\] = 1 for all students.
> 3. If M\[i\]\[j\] = 1, then M\[j\]\[i\] = 1.

## Solution: UnionFind

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.nums = [n for n in range(size)]
        self.s = size
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        root_x = self.find(x)
        root_y = self.find(y)
        if root_x == root_y:
            return False
        # y is alway bigger than x, so it should always change the root of bigger number
        # and it has to change the root value root_y instead of y
        self.nums[root_y] = root_x
        self.s -= 1
        return True
    
    def find(self, x):
        # Compact while finding
        if self.nums[x]!=x:
            self.nums[x]=self.find(self.nums[x])
        return self.nums[x]
    
    def getSize(self):
        return self.s
        
class Solution:
    def findCircleNum(self, M):
        """
        :type M: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l = len(M)
        uf = UnionFind(l)
        for i in range(l):
            for j in range(i+1, l):
                if M[i][j]==1:
                    uf.union(i,j)
        return uf.getSize()
