# 202. Happy Number

> Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
>
> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 \(where it will stay\), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

> **Example:** 
>
> ```text
> Input: 19
> Output: true
> Explanation: 
> 12 + 92 = 82
> 82 + 22 = 68
> 62 + 82 = 100
> 12 + 02 + 02 = 1
> ```

## Solution 1: HashSet and Math

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = set()
        while n not in s:
            s.add(n)
            cur = n
            new_n = 0
            while cur != 0:
                mod = cur%10
                cur = cur//10
                new_n += mod*mod
            n=new_n
            if n==1: return True
        return False
```

## Solution 2: Simpler but slower\(convert integer into string\)

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        s = set()
        while n not in s:
            s.add(n)
            n = sum([int(i)**2 for i in str(n)])
            if n==1: return True
        return False
```
