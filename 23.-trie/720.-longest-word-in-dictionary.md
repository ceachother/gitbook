# 720. Longest Word in Dictionary

> Given a list of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in `words` that can be built one character at a time by other words in `words`. If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.If there is no answer, return the empty string.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
> Output: "world"
> Explanation: 
> The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: 
> words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
> Output: "apple"
> Explanation: 
> Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
>
> The length of `words` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
>
> The length of `words[i]` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.

## Solution: Trie

```python
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = [None]*26
        
    def add(self, s):
        node = self.head
        for i in range(len(s)):
            idx = ord(s[i])-ord('a')
            if node[idx]:
                node=node[idx]
            elif i==len(s)-1:
                node[idx]=[None]*26
            else:
                return False
        return True

class Solution:
    def longestWord(self, words):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :rtype: str
        """
        
        words.sort(key = len)
        t = Trie()
        ans = ""
        for w in words:
            if not t.add(w):
                continue
            if len(w)>len(ans):
                ans = w
            elif len(w)==len(ans):
                i=0
                while i<len(ans)-1 and w[i]==ans[i]:
                    i+=1
                if ord(w[i])<ord(ans[i]):
                    ans = w
        return ans
