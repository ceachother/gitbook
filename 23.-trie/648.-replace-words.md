# 648. Replace Words

> In English, we have a concept called `root`, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let's call this word `successor`. For example, the root `an`, followed by `other`, which can form another word `another`.
>
> Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the `successor` in the sentence with the `root` forming it. If a `successor` has many `roots` can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.
>
> You need to output the sentence after the replacement.
>
> **Example 1:**  
>
>
> ```text
> Input: dict = ["cat", "bat", "rat"]
> sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
> Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
> ```
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. The input will only have lower-case letters.
> 2. 1 &lt;= dict words number &lt;= 1000
> 3. 1 &lt;= sentence words number &lt;= 1000
> 4. 1 &lt;= root length &lt;= 100
> 5. 1 &lt;= sentence words length &lt;= 1000

## Solution: Trie

```python
class Node:        
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = [None]*26
        self.word = None
    
    def putWord(self, word):
        self.word = word
        
class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tree = [None]*26
    
    def add(self, w):
        nds = self.tree
        for i in range(len(w)):
            idx = ord(w[i])-ord('a')
            if not nds[idx]:
                nds[idx] = Node()
            if i==len(w)-1:
                nds[idx].putWord(w)
            nds = nds[idx].nodes
    
    def getPrefix(self, w):
        nds = self.tree
        for i in range(len(w)):
            idx = ord(w[i])-ord('a')
            if nds[idx]:
                if nds[idx].word:
                    return nds[idx].word
                nds = nds[idx].nodes
            else:
                break
        return None
