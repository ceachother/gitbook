# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

> Given a binary tree

> ```text
> struct TreeLinkNode {
>   TreeLinkNode *left;
>   TreeLinkNode *right;
>   TreeLinkNode *next;

> Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.
>
> Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * You may only use constant extra space.
> * Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

> **Example:**

> Given the following binary tree,

> ```text
>      1
>    /  \
>   2    3
>  / \    \
> 4   5    7

> After calling your function, the tree should look like:

> ```text
>      1 -> NULL
>    /  \

## Solution BFS in place

```java
public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
    TreeLinkNode prev = null;
    TreeLinkNode nextLine = null;
    while(root != null) {
        if(root.left != null) {
            if(prev != null) {
                prev.next = root.left;
            } else {
                nextLine = root.left;
            }
            prev = root.left;
        }
        if(root.right != null) {
            if(prev != null) {
                prev.next = root.right;
            } else {
                nextLine = root.right;
            }
            prev = root.right;
        }
        root = root.next;
        if(root == null) {
            root = nextLine;
            prev = null;
            nextLine = null;
        }
    }
}
```

If use queue, then the space would be linear, so if want to keep constant space complexity, use a TreeLinkNode as previous node, and another one as nextLine node which will be assign a value when first time assign a value to previous node at each line.

### Complexity analysis

Time: linear

Space: Constant
