# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
> According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”
>
> Given the following binary search tree:  root = \[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4\]

## Solution: DFS

```text
public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        
        if(root == p || root == q || root == null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        if(left != null && right != null) {
            return root;
        }
        if(left == null && right == null) {
            return null;
        }
        return left == null ? right : left;
    }
```

There are few situations:

If the root equals to p or q, then return p or q\(If the root is null then return null\);

If left and right are not null, it means there are target nodes on both sides, so root will be the node to be returned\(vice versa, if left and right are null, then return null\);

if one of the side is not null, it means the other one is in somewhere else, so return one of the nodes for future use. If found another node one the same side along the path to top, return the higher one, if it is on the other side, return the root.

Time Complexity: O\(n\), n is the number of nodes.

The space complexity is constant, it use way less space than the stack space.
