# 269. Alien Dictionary

> #### Description
>
> There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of **non-empty** words from the dictionary, where words are **sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language**. Derive the order of letters in this language.
>
> 1. You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
> 2. You may assume that if a is a prefix of b, then a must appear before b in the given dictionary.
> 3. If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
> 4. There may be multiple valid order of letters, `return the smallest in lexicographical order`

> #### Example
>
> Given the following words in dictionary,
>
> ```text
> [
>   "wrt",
>   "wrf",
>   "er",
>   "ett",
>   "rftt"
> ]
> ```
>
> The correct order is: `"wertf"`
>
> Given the following words in dictionary,
>
> ```text
> [
>   "z",
>   "x"
> ]
> ```
>
> The correct order is: `"zx"`.
