# 37. Sudoku Solver

> Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
>
> A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:
>
> 1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
> 2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
> 3. Each of the the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.
>
> Empty cells are indicated by the character `'.'`.

### Complexity Analyse

O\(9^81\)

#### Explanation

Many recursive searches can be modeled as a tree. In Sodoku, you have **9 possibilities** each time you try out a new field. At maximum, you have to put solutions into all 81 fields. At this point it can help drawing it up in order to see, that the resulting search **space is a tree with a depth of 81 and a branching factor of 9** at each node of each layer, and each leaf is a possible solution. Given these numbers, the search space is **9^81**.

or:

This can be seen by working backwards from only a **single** blank. If there is only one blank, then you have _**9 possibilities**_ that you must work through in the worst case. If there are **two** blanks, then you must work through _**9**_ **possibilities for the first** blank and _**9**_ **possibilities for the second blank** for each of the possibilities for the first blank. If there are three blanks, then you must work through _n_ possibilities for the first blank.
