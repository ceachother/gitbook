# 23. Merge k Sorted List

> Merge _k_ sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> [
>   1->4->5,
>   1->3->4,
>   2->6
> ]
> Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
> ```

## Solution: Divide And Conquer

```text

```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : O\(N\log k\)O\(Nlogk\) where \text{k}k is the number of linked lists.
  * We can merge two sorted linked list in O\(n\)O\(n\) time where nn is the total number of nodes in two lists.
  * Sum up the merge process and we can get: O\big\(\sum\_{i=1}^{log\_{2}{k}}N \big\)= O\(N\log k\)O\(∑​i=1​log​2​​k​​N\)=O\(Nlogk\)
* Space complexity : O\(1\)O\(1\)
  * We can merge two sorted linked lists in O\(1\)O\(1\) space.
