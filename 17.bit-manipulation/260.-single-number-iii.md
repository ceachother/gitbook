# 260. Single Number III

> Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```text
> Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
> Output: [3,5]
> ```

> 1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
> 2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Solution: Bit Manipulation

Note: you can use num&\(-num\) to get the last 1

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        diff = 0
        for n in nums:
            diff ^= n
        #find the last bit which is 1
        diff = diff&(-diff)
        ans = [0,0]
        for n in nums:
            if n&diff:
                ans[0]^=n
            else:
                ans[1]^=n
        return ans
```
