# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String

> Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.
>
> Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.
>
> The order of output does not matter.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"
>
> Output:
> [0, 6]
>
> Explanation:
> The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
> The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> s: "abab" p: "ab"
>
> Output:
> [0, 1, 2]
>
> Explanation:
> The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
> The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
> The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

## Solution 1: Brute Force\(TLE\)

## Solution 2: Hash Table and sliding window

```text
public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        int[] hashtable = new int[256];
        int pLen = p.length();
        for(int i = 0; i<pLen; i++) {
            char c = p.charAt(i);
            hashtable[c]++;
        }
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        int begin = 0;
        int diff = pLen;
        for(int end = 0; end<s.length(); end++) {
            char c = s.charAt(end);
            hashtable[c]--;
            //why use great than? because same char can occur many times in p
            if(hashtable[c] >= 0) {
                diff--;
            }
            if(end - begin + 1 == pLen) {
                if(diff == 0) {
                    list.add(begin);
                }
                //slide window
                hashtable[s.charAt(begin)]++;
                if(hashtable[s.charAt(begin)] > 0) {
                    diff++;
                }
                begin++;
            }
        }
        return list;
    }
```

use a 256 char table to store characters in string p, then use diff to show the difference between the character in window and string p.

Note that same character can occur in string p more than one time.
