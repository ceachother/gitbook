# 734. Sentence Similarity

> Given two sentences `words1, words2` \(each represented as an array of strings\), and a list of similar word pairs `pairs`, determine if two sentences are similar.
>
> For example, "great acting skills" and "fine drama talent" are similar, if the similar word pairs are `pairs = [["great", "fine"], ["acting","drama"], ["skills","talent"]]`.
>
> Note that the similarity relation is not transitive. For example, if "great" and "fine" are similar, and "fine" and "good" are similar, "great" and "good" are **not** necessarily similar.
>
> However, similarity is symmetric. For example, "great" and "fine" being similar is the same as "fine" and "great" being similar.
>
> Also, a word is always similar with itself. For example, the sentences `words1 = ["great"], words2 = ["great"], pairs = []` are similar, even though there are no specified similar word pairs.
>
> Finally, sentences can only be similar if they have the same number of words. So a sentence like `words1 = ["great"]` can never be similar to `words2 = ["doubleplus","good"]`.
>
> **Note:**
>
> > The length of `words1` and `words2` will not exceed `1000`.
> >
> > The length of `pairs` will not exceed `2000`.
> >
> > The length of each `pairs[i]` will be `2`.
> >
> > The length of each `words[i]` and `pairs[i][j]` will be in the range `[1, 20]`.

## Solution: Hashtable and HashSet

Note: This solution uses map.putIfAbsent from Java 8.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String[] words1, String[] words2, String[][] pairs) {
        int len1 = words1.length;
        int len2 = words2.length;
        if(len1 != len2) return false;
        
        Map<String, Set<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i<pairs.length; i++) {
            map.putIfAbsent(pairs[i][0], new HashSet<String>());
            map.get(pairs[i][0]).add(pairs[i][1]);
            map.putIfAbsent(pairs[i][1], new HashSet<String>());
            map.get(pairs[i][1]).add(pairs[i][0]);
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i<words1.length; i++) {
            String w1 = words1[i];
            String w2 = words2[i];
            if(!w1.equals(w2) &&
               (!map.containsKey(w1) || !map.get(w1).contains(w2))) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
