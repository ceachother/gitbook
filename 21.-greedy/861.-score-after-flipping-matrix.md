# 861. Score After Flipping Matrix

> We have a two dimensional matrix `A` where each value is `0` or `1`.
>
> A move consists of choosing any row or column, and toggling each value in that row or column: changing all `0`s to `1`s, and all `1`s to `0`s.
>
> After making any number of moves, every row of this matrix is interpreted as a binary number, and the score of the matrix is the sum of these numbers.
>
> Return the highest possible score.
>
> 1. 
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,1,0],[1,1,0,0]]
> Output: 39
> Explanation:
> Toggled to [[1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1]].
> 0b1111 + 0b1001 + 0b1111 = 15 + 9 + 15 = 39
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> 1. `1 <= A.length <= 20`
> 2. `1 <= A[0].length <= 20`
> 3. `A[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution: Greedy

> For the first row, the XOR will return all zeros, as you are comparing to itself. From here, the R \(number of row\) - your col will return R, meaning that every row is set to one. 
>
> Once this is complete, you will go to the next row, which you will compare with the first row. XOR simply returns 1 if the item you are looking at is different from what you have in row zero. Col will be the number of digits different from that in the first column.

```python
class Solution:
    def matrixScore(self, A):
        """
        :type A: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        R = len(A)
        C = len(A[0])
        ans = 0
        for c in range(C):
            col = 0
            for r in range(R):
                col += A[r][c] ^ A[r][0]
            ans += max(col, R-col) * (1<<(C-c-1))
        return ans
