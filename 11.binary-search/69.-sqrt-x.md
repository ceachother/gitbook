## Solution: Binary Search

```text
public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x <= 1) {
            return x;
        }
        long lower = 0;
        long upper = x;
        while(lower < upper) {
            //num is the floor of the real mid
            long mid = lower+(upper-lower)/2;
            if(mid*mid <= x) {
                lower = mid+1;
            } else {
                upper = mid;
            }
        }
        return (int)(upper-1);
    }
```

There are few things need to be taken into consideration in this question:

1. Here using a theorem: when x is greater than 4, the middle value is always greater than or equals to sqrt\(x\)\(middle &gt;= sqrt\(x\)  -&gt;  power\(middle,2\) &gt;= x\).
2. when calculating the mid of of lower and upper, the mid is floor of the actual mid. So if the mid power is greater than x, since the mid has been already set to the floor of the real mid, so instead of assigning mid-1 to upper, we assign mid to upper. If the mid power is smaller than x, since we have use the floor mid, so can't use mid as lower anymore, so lower = mid + 1.
3. In each iteration, we are actually looking for the nearest value on the **right side** to square\(x\)\(which is **greater than** the square\(x\)\), so we return the upper-1 as the result.
4. when calculating the power\(mid ,2\), it could exceed the limit of Integer and cause negative value. Either use type long or use condition: mid &lt;= x/mid will solve this problem.
5. We also have to take care of the corner case 0 and 1 since the nearest number on the right side to the "real root" is out of the range at the beginning.

There is another way to calculate the mid, which is using the ceiling of real mid, and return the low. In this case we are looking for the nearest value is **not greater than** the real root:

```text
int mySqrt(int x) {        long lo = 0, hi = x;        while (lo < hi) {            long mid = lo + (hi - lo + 1) / 2;            if (mid * mid <= x) {                lo = mid;            } else {                hi = mid - 1;            }        }        return lo;    }
```
