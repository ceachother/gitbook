# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

> Koko loves to eat bananas.  There are `N` piles of bananas, the `i`-th pile has `piles[i]` bananas.  The guards have gone and will come back in `H`hours.
>
> Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `K`.  Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas, and eats K bananas from that pile.  If the pile has less than `K` bananas, she eats all of them instead, and won't eat any more bananas during this hour.
>
> Koko likes to eat slowly, but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards come back.
>
> Return the minimum integer `K` such that she can eat all the bananas within `H` hours.

## Leetcode Solution

> **Approach 1: Binary Search**
>
> **Intuition**
>
> If Koko can finish eating all the bananas \(within `H` hours\) with an eating speed of `K`, she can finish with a larger speed too.
>
> If we let `possible(K)` be `true` if and only if Koko can finish with an eating speed of `K`, then there is some `X` such that `possible(K) = True` if and only if `K >= X`.
>
> For example, with `piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]` and `H = 8`, there is some `X = 4`so that `possible(1) = possible(2) = possible(3) = False`, and `possible(4) = possible(5) = ... = True`.
>
> **Algorithm**
>
> We can binary search on the values of `possible(K)` to find the first `X` such that `possible(X)` is `True`: that will be our answer. Our loop invariant will be that `possible(hi)` is always `True`, and `lo` is always less than or equal to the answer.

>
> To find the value of `possible(K)`, \(ie. whether `Koko` with an eating speed of `K`can eat all bananas in `H` hours\), we simulate it. For each pile of size `p > 0`, we can deduce that Koko finishes it in `Math.ceil(p / K) = ((p-1) // K) + 1`hours, and we add these times across all piles and compare it to `H`.
