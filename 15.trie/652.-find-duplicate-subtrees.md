# 652. Find Duplicate Subtrees

> Given a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees. For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any **one** of them.
>
> Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with same node values.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
>         1
>        / \
>       2   3
>      /   / \
>     4   2   4
>        /
>       4
> ```
>
> The following are two duplicate subtrees:
>
> ```text
>       2
>      /
>     4
> ```
>
> and
>
> ```text
>     4
> ```
>
> Therefore, you need to return above trees' root in the form of a list.

## Solution: Serialization and DFS

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findDuplicateSubtrees(self, root):
        count = collections.Counter()
        ans = []
        def collect(node):
            if not node: return "#"
            serial = "{},{},{}".format(node.val, collect(node.left), collect(node.right))
            count[serial] += 1
            if count[serial] == 2:
                ans.append(node)
            return serial

        collect(root)
        return ans
```

### Complexity analysis

> * Time Complexity: O\(N^2\)O\(N2\), where NN is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node once, but each creation of `serial`may take O\(N\)O\(N\) work.
> * Space Complexity: O\(N^2\)O\(N2\), the size of `count`.
