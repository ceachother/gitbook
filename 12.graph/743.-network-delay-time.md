# 743. Network Delay Time

> There are `N` network nodes, labelled `1` to `N`.
>
> Given `times`, a list of travel times as **directed** edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)`, where `u` is the source node, `v` is the target node, and `w` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.
>
> Now, we send a signal from a certain node `K`. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return `-1`.
>
> **Note:**  
>
>
> 1. `N` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
> 2. `K` will be in the range `[1, N]`.
> 3. The length of `times` will be in the range `[1, 6000]`.
> 4. All edges `times[i] = (u, v, w)` will have `1 <= u, v <= N` and `1 <= w <= 100`.

## Solution 1: Dijkstra

Only scan $$n^2$$ times \($$n, n-1, n-2.....1$$\). Because everything scan only picks the shortest path and won't track back. 

```python
def networkDelayTime(self, times, N, K):
    """
    :type times: List[List[int]]
    :type N: int
    :type K: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in times:
        graph[u].append((v, w))

    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in xrange(1, N + 1)}
    seen = [False] * (N + 1)
    dist[K] = 0

    while True:
        cand_node = -1
        cand_dist = float('inf')
        for i in xrange(1, N + 1):
            if not seen[i] and dist[i] < cand_dist:
                cand_dist = dist[i]
                cand_node = i

        if cand_node < 0: break
        seen[cand_node] = True
        for nei, d in graph[cand_node]:
            dist[nei] = min(dist[nei], dist[cand_node] + d)

    ans = max(dist.values())
    return ans if ans < float('inf') else -1
```

## Solution 2: DFS

Because it will track back, so it will take exponential time.

```python
def networkDelayTime(self, times, N, K):
    """
    :type times: List[List[int]]
    :type N: int
    :type K: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    time_map = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in times:
        time_map[u].append([w, v])
    
    arv = {n : float('inf') for n in range(1, N+1)}
    total = N
    def dfs(crt_time, node):
        if crt_time>= arv[node]: return
        arv[node] = crt_time
        for w, v in sorted(time_map[node]):
            dfs(crt_time+w, v)
    
    dfs(0, K)
    ans = max(arv.values())
    return ans if ans<float('inf') else -1
```
