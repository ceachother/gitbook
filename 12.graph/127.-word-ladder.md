# 127. Word Ladder

> Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:
>
> 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
> 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.
>
> **Note:**
>
> * Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
> * All words have the same length.
> * All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
> * You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
> * You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit",
> endWord = "cog",
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
>
> Output: 5
>
> Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
> return its length 5.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```text
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit"
> endWord = "cog"
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
>
> Output: 0
>
> Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

This kind of problems belong to the undirected and unweighted graph. Even though it is really hard to think to use **BFS** or **Bidirectional BFS** for me, it should be. 

```text
public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(beginWord);
        //the first step is already taken
        int step = 1;
        //this is the count in last level
        int lastCount = 1;
        int count = 0;
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            String word = queue.poll();
            for(int i = 0; i<word.length();i++) {
                for(char c = 'a'; c<= 'z';c++) {
                    String nw = word.replace(word.charAt(i), c);
                    if(set.contains(nw)) {
                        if(nw.equals(endWord)) {
                            return step+1;
                        }
                        count++;
                        queue.add(nw);
                        set.remove(nw);
                    }
                } 
            }
            lastCount--;
            if(lastCount == 0) {
                lastCount = count;
                count = 0;
                step++;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
```

### Complexity Analysis

Time: O\(n\*26^l\), l is the length of the word, n is the size of the wordList,

for Bidirectional, the time becomes to O\(n\*26^\(1/2\)\).
