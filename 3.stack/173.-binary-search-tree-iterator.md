# 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

> Implement an iterator over a binary search tree \(BST\). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
>
> Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.
>
> **Note:** `next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average O\(1\) time and uses O\(h\) memory, where h is the height of the tree.

## Solution: Stack

```java
/**
 * Definition for binary tree
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

public class BSTIterator {
    Deque<TreeNode> stack;
    
    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        if(root == null) return;
        TreeNode node = root;
        stack.push(node);
        addLeft(root);
    }
    
    public void addLeft(TreeNode node) {
        while(node.left != null) {
            stack.push(node.left);
            node = node.left;
        }
    }

    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !stack.isEmpty();
    }

    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        TreeNode node = stack.pop();
        if(node.right != null) {
            stack.push(node.right);
            addLeft(node.right);
        }
        return node.val;
    }
}

/**
 * Your BSTIterator will be called like this:
 * BSTIterator i = new BSTIterator(root);
 * while (i.hasNext()) v[f()] = i.next();
 */
```

> This is in fact average O\(1\) time. The while loop is misleading you to think it is not. Think about the number of times a node has been visited after iterating the whole tree. Each node has been visited twice. In some cases the while loop doesn't execute, so that node at that call is only visited once. Where does the other visit go? It goes to the while loop when you visit another node. That's why it's "average" O\(1\) time.
